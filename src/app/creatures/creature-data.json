Now abandoned, the golems have difficulty pinpointing friend from foe due to a lack of circuitry maintanence.

The fruit matures into baby pominids, which fall to the ground by giving birth. Pominids believe that the number of pominids a pominid tree produces in their afterlife is determined by how many strangers the pominid helped during its lifetime. A pominid only lives an average of 50 years, and thus their desire to help others occasionally manifests as an overwhelming generosity."
