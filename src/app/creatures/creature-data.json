Sometimes, when a forest is in great peril, this process will happen on its own, and a forest giant will be born unto the wilderness that has need of it.",

They are quite small as giants stand, reaching only 10 to 12 feet in height. They make no homes and hunt no game, preferring to eat leaves of the trees they can now reach. Forest giants have a keener intellect than what their animalistic nature suggests, using simple weapons and crafting materials to outfit themselves."
