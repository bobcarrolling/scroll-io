The howdah on their back was meant as a means of escape and protection for fleeing dwarves. Their powerful arms would shock any monster into submission, while the beam that shot from their chest could melt through stone.\n\nNow abandoned, the golems have difficulty pinpointing friend from foe due to a lack of circuitry maintanence.

A casket or other funerary burial container can be inscribed with runes of dark magics lost to all but those who pervert the ancient art of voodoo. While the underlying belief of voodooism embraces the spirits that journey between the land of the living and the dead, the twisted ritual that creates the enchanted coffin tears a hole between the two worlds in order to let the unliving energy spill forth.",
          "It can sometimes take weeks to inscribe the obscene markings within the coffin, but once finished the magical engravings become invisible to the naked eye. Those that choose to create one may turn to grave robbing, otherwise more nefarious mages may curse a coffin before a burial takes place."

Voodooism as a religion contacts one's spiritual ancestors for guidance, but the corruption of this sacred contract drives the souls beyond the veil mad with necromantic malevolence. Voodoo coffins seek out the descendants of the one who was buried within, or descendants of their predecessors. Once set on the trail of their targets, the voodoo coffin will not stop until it has devoured every last bit of its own bloodline. If a well-studied mage knows the burial place of their enemies forbearers, placing the voodoo curse on their coffin would create a ceaseless killer to hunt them to their end."

Once pulled within the interior where the poisonous smog of decay pours from, the coughing and gagging subject may see the swirling void of ravenous souls beyond a portal where the bottom of the coffin once belonged. No body remains inside, only the infinite deathly darkness beyond and the spirits that clamor forth to claim another vessel. Even if a victim is able to wrench themselves from the ghostly hands lunging from the Shaderealms, the experience is enough to traumatize the soundest of minds into a state of insanity."

Its approach is simple - repeatedly using its pluck to grapple its target inside its coffin body, and use its disgorge when it can to keep other interlopers away.",
          "To the further dismay of adventurers, a party member killed inside makes the voodoo coffin stronger. It will immediately disgorge the victim and allow the mummy of their former friend to fight. After disgorging its bloodline relation, the coffin will retreat.

When passing, other pominids will bury their bodies within lush groves. From the deceased grows a pominid tree, which after time bears fruit. The fruit matures into baby pominids, which fall to the ground by giving birth. Pominids believe that the number of pominids a pominid tree produces in their afterlife is determined by how many strangers the pominid helped during its lifetime. A pominid only lives an average of 50 years, and thus their desire to help others occasionally manifests as an overwhelming generosity.\n\n\n\n"

Were a dragon tortoise to unleash its full fury, few mortal creatures could bear it. The more pesky and relentless foes are turned back by its warming breath, which soothes the very soul. To truly fight a dragon tortoise, one must speak with it and have cause to challenge it to an honorable duel. Even then, the dragon will likely decline unless it feels its competitors are worthy of a challenge, and will not kill a creature lesser than itself.",

These melee attacks may pack a punch, but the dragon tortoise is still very weak to spells and attacks made from long ranges. It deems such combat as dishonorable, and will have no hesitation in ending an unfair fight with its warming breath, or by retreating with its withdrawal and digging underground until its enemies draw close."

Sometimes, when a forest is in great peril, this process will happen on its own, and a forest giant will be born unto the wilderness that has need of it.",

They are quite small as giants stand, reaching only 10 to 12 feet in height. They make no homes and hunt no game, preferring to eat leaves of the trees they can now reach. Forest giants have a keener intellect than what their animalistic nature suggests, using simple weapons and crafting materials to outfit themselves."

When their task is deemed complete by their creator, or they grow too old, they are returned to their bestial form to live out the remainder of their now mortal days, and another animal protector is raised to answer the call."

          "A xylodynn seldom fights alone, and will issue orders to its underlings to have them fight much more tactically than a normal disorganized demon horde. Rather than sitting back and letting its lackeys fight for it, a xylodynn is more than willing to jump in and out of the thick of battle using its augmented flight. No military formation can stand against it as it pulls creatures away with its hook claws, then tosses them afar with its horn.",
          "A xylodynn fights extremely optimally and makes very few mistakes when engaging in combat - that is, until it hears spellcasting. While its spell hatred reaction is quite strong, it can be used as a weakness against a xylodynn since they won't resist the urge to strike out at a mage. Baiting a xylodynn by casting spells is very easy, but the demon will likely become even angrier after being outsmarted. That anger might lead it to be more analytic in its decisions, or it may fly into a heated raging fury that could lead to even more slip-ups.",
          "Though not cowardly, a xylodynn knows the importance of a retreat. When battles turn for the worse, a xylodynn will make haste to escape, plotting to return with a force strong enough to crush those who bested it."

This is intentional, as presenting too many factual ties would inevitably overlap your own ideas of who Absolution could be. What is written below is instead a list of possible ways Absolution could be included in your campaign, with very little instruction shackling them to a single perspective. Let loose your creativity and read along for an inspirational journey."

Armed with a modestly strong AC and an immense saving throw DC, Absolution will make quick work of a party that relies heavily on advantage for high rolls. Succeeding the initial saving throw or boosting a character's base Wisdom score can be crucial to winning the fight.",

Absolution's legendary resistances, paired with their legendary might, makes them a formidably versatile and well equipped opponent even when its not their turn.",
          "Coming prepared to resist radiant damage against Absolution is smart, but alternative breath weapons provide adaptability that is beyond player control. Absolution's sun breath is staggeringly powerful and able to be focused to even greater strengths at the cost of Absolution's legendary resistances. Their moon breath is much more like a standard dragon's breath weapon, but deals many types of damage to overwhelm resistant players.",

When things are dire, Absolution will use their legendary actions to use their healing touch on themselves. This defensive strategy can be a signal to players that Absolution is on the ropes, and keeping up the offensive could soon lead to victory.",

Also called a snowfeather hare, bulu intercede between a hunter and their quarry, long enough for the prey to escape. It is both a beautiful and melancholy sight, as bulu are said to only appear to hunters who will very soon pass away. At the very least, it is common that a hunter who witnesses a bulu never hunts again.",
          "The science behind this phenomenon is dubious. Bulu have been captured and studied, though with great difficulty. It has been discovered that a celestial protection enshrouds the creatures. Their innocence is so compelling that magic, space, time, and nature themselves bend around a bulu to protect it. The hare's absolute inability to cause harm is seen as the source of this heavenly blessing.",
          "Philosophers hypothesize that hunters who cease their profession after viewing a bulu may be suffering from its celestial aftereffects, and can no longer willingly hurt an innocent creature. What cannot be proven, but has strong evidence supporting it, is the conclusion that harming a bulu does eventually bring about a terrible curse. After all, every critic that ensnares a bulu to curiously prod and provoke it meets their end in horrific fashion, or disappears entirely."

Denizens of lower planes have broken contracts just for a morsel, no matter how binding their word.
